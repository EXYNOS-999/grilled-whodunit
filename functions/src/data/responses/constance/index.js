Betsy thought a few transgressions from our youth gave her unlimited warrant to terrorize my family, and I had to see to it that it stopped. I slipped into the back door when I knew she was there, then pushed her into the closet when she wasn\'t looking and set my problems ablaze. I\'m not sorry either. This may be the end of my story, but now Pete and Brandi can live their lives without the cloud of Betsy\'s spite following them around.</emphasis>',
