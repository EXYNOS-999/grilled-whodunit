	[keys.CONST_WHYTUCKERTHRILLED]: 'He worked for Pete before Betsy\'s. Pete hired tucker when he was just a stray scraggly puppy and taught him everything he knew.

Now he\'s simply cashing in, you see.<break time="1s" /> You really ought to speak with him about it.',
	[keys.CONST_WHATSTRATEGY]: 'Betsy thought she could just buy her way into business by stealing Tucker, then buying some fancy BBQ recipe. It was shameful that she could be so flippant and have such success at Pete\'s expense.

But when Betsy found out Brandi Lynn is Pete\'s daughter she simply lost her mind and fired dear Brandi.',
	[keys.CONST_YOUANDBETSYHATE]: 'Well I grew up wealthier than most, I\'ll admit it. Betsy was the child of my family\'s maid. I maybe teased her a bit, but it was so easy and harmless. We used to hide her clothes while she was swimming and poke fun at the way she talked. It was just innocent kids stuff. But Betsy seemed to get madder and madder about it as each year passed. Some people can be so small minded. The things she\'s done in retaliation over the years outweigh anything I did to her as a child. ',
