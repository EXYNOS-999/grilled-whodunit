	[keys.TELLABOUTSELF]: 'I ran what was once the most successful barbecue joint here in Lockhart, Texas. Then Betsy came along and put me out of business.',

	//core
	[keys.WHATRELATIONSHIPTOBETSY]: 'We were business competitors, and all is fair in love and war<break time=".4s" /> and business<break time=".4s" /> when no one\'s looking.',
	[keys.ANGRYWITHBETSY]: 'Yeah I had a few reasons to be angry at Betsy, but none strong enough to want to kill her.',
	[keys.HOWLONGKNOWBETSY]: 'My whole life unfortunately. Actually longer she hated me before I was born.',
	[keys.WHOKILLEDBETSY]: 'I know it wasn\'t me.',
	[keys.NIGHTOF]: 'I was alone at my restaurant, cleaning it out. I can\'t believe we\'re closing down this week.',
	[keys.DIDYOUKILLHER]: 'Nope. I cook pigs, not people. Besides, I was at my restaurant all night, on the other side of town.',

	//realization 1
	[keys.TELLABOUTTUCKER]: 'Tucker Mitts was Betsy\'s head chef and is my daughter\'s boyfriend. He says he loves her, but the guy worked for me for 5 years and I\'ve seen how he is. But Brandi won\'t listen to me.',
	[keys.TELLABOUTBRANDI]: 'Brandi Lynn is my baby daughter. She\'s just turned 21, so I guess I need to get used to the idea of her being an adult.',
	[keys.TELLABOUTPETE]: 'guy.<break delay="1s" /> Are you paying attention?',
	[keys.TELLABOUTCONSTANCE]: 'Constance is my mother. She\'s been a pillar in the Lockhart community for nearly 40 years and before that was raised here.',
	[keys.PETE_WHODAUGHTER]: 'Brandi Lynn is my baby daughter. She\'s just turned 21, so I guess I need to get used to the idea of her being an adult.',
	[keys.PETE_WHOMOTHER]: 'Constance is my mother. She\'s been a pillar in the Lockhart community for nearly 40 years and before that was raised here.',
	[keys.PETE_WHODAUGHTERBF]: 'Tucker Mitts was Betsy\'s head chef and is my daughter\'s boyfriend. He says he loves her, but the guy worked for me for 5 years and I\'ve seen how he is. But Brandi won\'t listen to me.',
	[keys.WHATBETSYDOBRANDI]: 'Brandi Lynn worked at Betsy\'s BBQ Shack up until last week when Betsy cornered poor Brandi and screamed at her in front of a crowd then fired her. It was sadistic if you ask me.',

	//realization 2
	[keys.PETE_WHYYOURFAULT]: 'Well, Betsy had this famous recipe that she didn\'t even create. She bought it. But it seemed like that was the difference in her taking business away from my place and ultimately shutting me down. So, A few months back my mom convinces me to enlist Brandi Lynn to go work for Betsy, since Betsy never knew Brandi Lynn. Well the idea was that Brandi Lynn would gain Betsy\'s trust and then convince Betsy to show her the recipe, then report back to us. The whole thing made me real uneasy, but I went through with it anyway. It blew up in Brandi Lynn\'s face when Betsy found out and now Betsy is dead.',
	[keys.PETE_WHYTUCKERHAPPY]: 'Tucker is the type of guy you just can\'t trust. I thought him and I were going to run my restaurant together for the next 20 years and I didn\'t get as much as a thanks when he jetted over to Betsy\'s new restaurant. Then I heard that Betsy made him a partner and even put him on the insurance. You know what that means right? He just got paid for the restaurant burning down and Betsy dying, and not a small amount either, so yeah. I\'d bet that snake is feeling pretty good.',
	[keys.WHYCONSTBETSYHATEEACHOTHER]: 'You\'re really going to have to ask my mom about that. The story has been told in so many ways, I just don\'t know what\'s true.',

	//peripheral	
	[keys.WHATRECIPE]: 'That\'s the million dollar question. If I could find some way to get my hands on it, I would. I guess you\'ll just have to ask Tucker, though. After all, he\'s the head chef.',
	[keys.BETSYDOSOMETHINGTOYOU]: 'Well I\'m embarrassed to say. Betsy put me out of business. I was going strong for a few years. She came onto the scene to compete and I was still in the lead. Then she bought that damn recipe and everything turned around from there.',
	[keys.WHENLASTSEEBETSY]: 'I think i saw her a week ago around town. I\'m not sure where.',
	[keys.PETE_WHYGOOUTOFBUSINESS]: 'Well I\'m embarrassed to say. Betsy put me out of business. I was going strong for a few years. She came onto the scene to compete and I was still in the lead. Then she bought that damn recipe and everything turned around from there.',
	[keys.PETE_HOWBETSYPUTYOUOUTBIZ]: 'Well, the only reason she got into business was to compete with me and by proxy stick it to my mom. Business was fine until she bought that recipe. Then she started crushing me.',
	[keys.PETE_WHYDAUGHTERFIRED]: 'Betsy was a rotten old lady and didn\'t really need a reason. Before last night, we hadn\'t spoken since she got fired, though. So you should ask Brandi Lynn.',
	[keys.PETE_WHYDAUGHTERWORKFORCOMP]: 'Ok I\'ll admit to it. Brandi Lynn was going to steal the recipe that put Betsy on top in Lockhart. It was my idea. That damn recipe.',
	[keys.PETE_WHYANGRYWITHBETSY]: 'She\'s been an enemy of my family since before I was born. I guess now that I think about it, the biggest reason I hated her, was because she hated me. She\'s always been mean to me',
	[keys.PETE_WHYENEMYOFFAM]: 'You\'ll really have to ask my mom about that',
	[keys.PETE_BETSYHATEBEFOREBORN]: 'Betsy and my mother had been feuding for decades. I don\'t even know why',
	[keys.PETE_WHEREDAUGHTERGOING]: 'I didn\'t say my daughter was going anywhere. What are you talking about?',
	[keys.PETE_WHYNOTTRUSTTUCKER]: 'He\'s got a few too many notches on the belt. I used to go out with him when i was bored. That guy doesn\'t care about anybody but himself',
	[keys.PETE_HOWFARRESTAURANTFROMBETSY]: 'It\'s not close, bud. I\'d say about a 20 minute drive.',
	[keys.PETE_WHATSPEAKABOUTDAUGHTER]: 'I didn\'t say I spoke with my daughter.',
	[keys.PETE_BRANDICALLLASTNIGHT]: 'She didn\'t call me last night.',
	[keys.PETE_ALONELASTNIGHT]: 'I didn\'t see anybody last night. I just put on some music and tried to make the best of breaking down my life\'s work to sell for parts.',
	[keys.PETE_CATCH_IN_LIE]: 'I never said anything about that. I don\'t know what you\'re talking about.',
