You guys should take a close look at him. I could totally see that snake dousing the place in turpentine, lighting a match and riding off into the sunset stinking rich.',

	[keys.TALKABOUTMURDER]: `All I know is that Betsy's dead. Someone doused the place in turpentine, set a match and that was all she wrote. `,
	[keys.BRANDIBFSUSPICIOUS]: `Of course he's suspicious. What with all of that insurance money he had to gain. I'll bet he's the one who soaked the place in paint thinner and set it ablaze. `,
	[keys.THINKOTHERSUSPECTKILLED_TUCKER]: `I think Tucker did it. He was on the insurance, and will definitely make a lot of money. I'll bet he's the one who poured turpentine all over the place and lit it on fire. `,
	[keys.TELLABOUTMURDER]: `What's there to tell? Someone poured paint thinner on the restaurant and turned it into an inferno.`,
	[keys.DOYOUTRUSTOTHERSUSPECT_TUCKER]: `He's not to be trusted. Not one bit. He tipped over that paint thinner, lit a match and can now retire on the insurance money`,
	[keys.WHYBETSYMURDERED]: `Betsy had all kinds of enemies. It was only a matter of time before someone soaked her in paint thinner and lit her up like a Christmas tree. `,
