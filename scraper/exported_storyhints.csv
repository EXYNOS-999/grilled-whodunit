"_level1_BRANDI_RELATION_Constance Florentine","Have you met my granddaughter? She’s very sweet."
"_level1_BRANDI_RELATION_Pete Judsen","This is all so horrible. I wonder how my daughter is doing."
"_level1_BRANDI_RELATION_Brandi Lynn Michelle","Is my dad in here also?"
"_level1_BRANDI_RELATION_Tucker Mitts","Hey, Are you guys holding my girlfriend?"
"_level1_PETE_RELATION_Constance Florentine","Dear. Before I forget, can you please pass a message to my son that i may not make dinner tonight?"
"_level1_PETE_RELATION_Pete Judsen","My mother is probably the authority on Betsy since they knew each other for so long. You should talk to her"
"_level1_PETE_RELATION_Brandi Lynn Michelle","You should talk to my dad if you haven’t already."
"_level1_PETE_RELATION_Tucker Mitts","And Brandi’s dad. Do you have him too?"
"_level1_CONSTANCE_RELATION_Constance Florentine","You might speak with my granddaughter. She worked for Betsy."
"_level1_CONSTANCE_RELATION_Pete Judsen","You know who knew Betsy the longest is my mother. She must have some interesting thoughts."
"_level1_CONSTANCE_RELATION_Brandi Lynn Michelle","Can you also tell me how is my grandmother?"
"_level1_CONSTANCE_RELATION_Tucker Mitts","Oh man. That would be hilarious if you’re holding Brandi’s grandmother. You’re not are you?"
"_level1_TUCKER_RELATION_Constance Florentine","You know, if this is any help. Betsy’s head chef is my granddaughter’s boyfriend."
"_level1_TUCKER_RELATION_Pete Judsen","I will admit I have conflicted feelings about all of this, but it’s truly sad for some. While working at Betsy’s BBQ, Brandi Lynn met her boyfriend."
"_level1_TUCKER_RELATION_Brandi Lynn Michelle","Did you bring in my boyfriend also?"
"_level1_TUCKER_RELATION_Tucker Mitts","Hmm. Have you met my girlfriend? She’s as smart as a whip."
"_level1_BRANDI_FIRED_Constance Florentine","You just have to wonder if this is just karma for what Betsy did to my granddaughter."
"_level1_BRANDI_FIRED_Pete Judsen","Man. Poor Brandi must have conflicted feelings after what Betsy did to her"
"_level1_BRANDI_FIRED_Brandi Lynn Michelle","Gosh. This is just all very confusing for me. I was so mad at Betsy for what she did last week"
"_level1_BRANDI_FIRED_Tucker Mitts","Boy I’ll bet Brandi is feeling weird about all this, with how Betsy embarrassed her last week"
"_level2_STEAL_THE_RECIPE_Constance Florentine","It’s such a shame. None of this would have happened if Brandi Lynn hadn’t messed up our little strategy."
"_level2_STEAL_THE_RECIPE_Pete Judsen","but If I’m being honest. This whole thing is probably all my fault"
"_level2_STEAL_THE_RECIPE_Brandi Lynn Michelle","Ok <break delay=""3s"" /> I’m just going to trust you and tell you this. I think all of this is my grandmother‘s fault"
"_level2_STEAL_THE_RECIPE_Tucker Mitts","It’s weird. I keep getting this feeling that this all somehow relates to Betsy’s secret recipe."
"_level2_TUCKER_INSURANCE_Constance Florentine","Oh I just had a thought. From what I’ve heard, I’ll bet that Tucker is thrilled with all of this."
"_level2_TUCKER_INSURANCE_Pete Judsen","Here’s another thought. if I were a betting man, I’d wager that Tucker is pretty happy about all of this. "
"_level2_TUCKER_INSURANCE_Brandi Lynn Michelle","Oh, before I forget to tell you this. Don’t jump to conclusions that Tucker killed her. He’s got too good of a heart to commit murder just for some insurance money"
"_level2_TUCKER_INSURANCE_Tucker Mitts","and just so we get this out of the way. Yes, I am a beneficiary on the restaurant’s insurance."
"_level2_BETSY_CONST_BACKGROUND_Constance Florentine","How much longer will this go? I swear, even in death that rotten lady has found a way to ruin my day with these horrible interrogations. That woman hated me so"
"_level2_BETSY_CONST_BACKGROUND_Pete Judsen","You know what else I just realized. This ends a 50 year feud for my mom and Betsy. More than any other 2 people i’ve met in my life, those two ladies hated each other something fierce"
"_level2_BETSY_CONST_BACKGROUND_Brandi Lynn Michelle","You know, this is probably going to sound wrong. But I’m relieved by the feud between my grandmother and Betsy ending"
"_level2_BETSY_CONST_BACKGROUND_Tucker Mitts","You know who’s probably finding a way to be happy about this is Constance. That lady hated Betsy."
