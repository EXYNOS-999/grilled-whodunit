"_welcome","<p>Hey detective,<break time="".35s"" /> thanks for coming by.</p><break time="".5s"" /> <p>Betsy Harris, owner of Betsy’s BBQ Shack, was found dead last night at 11pm.<break time=""1s"" /> We have detained 4 suspects and they are awaiting questioning.<break time="".6s"" /> None of them are career criminals, so try to find the nervous one, and catch them in a lie.<break time="".3s"" /> When you’re ready you can then say</p><p> “I’d like to press charges” and then be prepared with your proof.</p>
    \t<break time="".6s"" /><p>I’m Police chief Hawkins. I'll be here to assist along the way.<break time="".6s"" /> You can begin by questioning the suspects. Or if this is your first time, ask me how to play the game.</p>"
"_listsuspects","The suspects are Brandi, Tucker, Pete and Constance. "
"_suggestions_catchkiller","There are a small set of things that can actually link the killer to the murder. They’ll either lie about their alibi, evidence found at the scene, or know information about the scene that hasn’t been released. Once you’ve found the lie, say ""I'd like to press charges"", then be prepared with your proof."
"_suggestions_interview","Are you new to this? Remember this is a police case. We need to establish their alibi, their relationship to the victim and potentially to one another. Try starting with ""where were you on the night of the murder,"" or, ""what was your relationship to the victim?"""
"_suggestions_toogeneric","Try asking more specific questions. Instead of saying something like Why did she do that? Say Why did Betsy fire Brandy?"
"_howto","<p>Here's how to play the game.</p><p> Interview each of the suspects, and listen closely to what they say. One of them is lying. </p><p>Also, pay attention to how they speak. Their voice may change when they get nervous.</p><p> When you you have uncovered the killer’s lie, say “I’d like to press charges”, then be prepared with your proof.</p>
\t\t<p>And remember, you can always ask suspects to repeat themselves. </p>

"_casefile","Last night, officers here in Lockhart Texas received a call about a fire at Betsy’s BBQ Shack. After the blaze was extinguished, they made a terrible discovery: owner, Betsy Harris, was found burned to death in the broom closet padlocked from the outside. Traces of turpentine were found around the ashes which we believe was used to accelerate the fire. We estimate the fire started at 8:45pm and time of death to be about 9:00pm. None of these details have been shared with the suspects."

I was just outside and the blast knocked me to the ground. I got up and kept running. It’s just so horrible. I never meant for any of this to happen.</emphasis>"

So, A few months back my mom convinces me to enlist Brandi Lynn to go work for Betsy, since Betsy never knew Brandi Lynn.  Well the idea was that Brandi Lynn would gain Betsy's trust and then convince Betsy to show her the recipe, then report back to us.
